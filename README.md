# Air Temperature Prediction of Machine at failure
This model predicts the Air temperature of a machine when machine failure occurs

Used sklearn, pandas, streamlit and Heroku.

The model is trained using Linear Regression
Dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository named AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset.
The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry.
